### 1. COVID-19 Data Exploration Project
This global COVID-19 impact analysis project uses death and vaccination data to understand the pandemic. Utilizing CTE and Partition by, it calculates cumulative vaccinated individuals, and a Tableau-ready view is created. Primary KPIs include total cases, deaths, death percentage, and global statistics, while secondary KPIs involve death rates, continent-wise death counts, population vaccination percentage, and cumulative vaccinations.
